# viperML-overlay

This is my personal overlay for Gentoo. It includes ebuilds written from scratch and modifications over existing ones.

To install:

- `# emerge app-eselect/eselect-repository`
- `# eselect repository add viperML-overlay git https://github.com/viperML/viperML-overlay`
- `# emerge --sync viperML-overlay`
