# Deprecated

I don't use Gentoo anymore, so this overlay is not maintained. Feel free to relocate any ebuild from here to your own overlay.

This is my personal overlay for Gentoo. It includes ebuilds written from scratch and modifications over existing ones.
I try to keep the quality as high as possible, and I use (or have used) these packages in my system, but mistakes can be made.

Feel free to submit pull requests to improve this overlay.

## Installation

```
# eselect repository enable viperML-overlay
# emaint sync -r viperML-overlay
```
