This is my personal overlay for Gentoo. It includes ebuilds written from scratch and modifications over existing ones.
I try to keep the quality as high as possible, and I use (or have used) these packages in my system, but mistakes can be made.

Feel free to submit pull requests to improve this overlay.

## Installation

```
# eselect-repository enable viperML-overlay
# emerge --sync viperML-overlay
```
